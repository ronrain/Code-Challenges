# Create a function named double_index that has two parameters: a list named my_list and a single number named index.

# The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in my_list except for the element at index. The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original my_list.

# If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.

# For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:

# double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)

# After writing your function, un-comment the call to the function that weâ€™ve provided for you to test your results.

def double_index(my_list, index):
  # Checks to see if index is too big
  if index >= len(my_list):
    return my_list
  else:
    # Gets the original list up to index
    my_new_list = my_list[0:index]
 # Adds double the value at index to the new list 
  my_new_list.append(my_list[index]*2)
  #  Adds the rest of the original list
  my_new_list = my_new_list + my_list[index+1:]
  return my_new_list
